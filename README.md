# What to do
 Interactive portal to recommend things to do on campus in your free time

Current functionalities:
* Given link of subject (such as: https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4890/MEAS/COMP_SCI), can scrape for class timings and locations allowing for queries about free classes in the day

Todo:
* Convert all list comprehensions to for loops with try/catch
* Serperate scraping and querying
* Allow for consecutive queries, keeping in mind choices (create day schedul for example)
